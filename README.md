# Why?
Amazon ECS (EC2 Container Service) provides an excellent platform for deploying microservices as containers.  The challenge however is that there is a significant learning curve for microservice developers to deploy their applications in an efficient manner.  Specifically, they must learn to use CloudFormation to orchestrate the management of ECS, ECR, EC2, ELB, VPC, and IAM resources.  Additionally, tools like CodeBuild and CodePipeline must be mastered to create a continuous delivery pipeline for their microservices.

To address these challenges, this tool was created to simplify the declaration and administration of the AWS resources necessary to support microservices.  Similar to how the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) improved the developer experience of Lambda and API Gateway, this tool makes it easier for developers to use ECS as a microservices platform.

The `mu` tool uses CloudFormation stacks to manage all resources it creates.  Additionally, `mu` will not create any databases or other AWS resources to support itself.  It will only create resources (via CloudFormation) necessary to run your microservices.  This means at any point you can stop using `mu` and continue to manage the AWS resources that it created via AWS tools such as the CLI or the console.

![Demo](https://github.com/stelligent/mu/wiki/quickstart/mu-quickstart.gif)

# Get Started!
Install latest version to /usr/local/bin (or for additional options, see [wiki](https://github.com/stelligent/mu/wiki/Installation)):

```bash
curl -s https://getmu.io/install.sh | sudo sh
```

Assuming your project already has a Dockerfile, you can initialize your mu.yml file with: `mu init`.  More details available in the [quickstart](https://github.com/stelligent/mu/wiki/Quickstart).

# What's next?
Check out the [examples](examples) to see snippets of `mu.yml` configuration files that you can use in your own project:

* **[Basic](examples/basic)** - Simple website with continuous delivery pipeline deploying to dev and prod environments
* **[Test Automation](examples/pipeline-newman)** - Automating end-to-end testing via [Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman)
* **[RDS Database](examples/database)** - Defining a database for a service

## Building from source

* Ensure [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) is configured with an access key, secret access key, and region.
* Install Go tools 1.9+ - (https://golang.org/doc/install)
* Install [Go Dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html)
* Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:stelligent/mu.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/stelligent/mu`
* Go to src `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/stelligent/mu`
* Run `dep ensure` to install dependencies
* Run `make gen` to generate missing go files
* Build with `make`
* Run unit tests with `make test`
* Run end-to-end tests with `make e2e`...takes about 30 minutes and will incur charges in your AWS account.
