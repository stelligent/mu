# Introduction
This a guide on how to approach learning [mu](https://github.com/stelligent/mu).  
If you follow this, you will be a mu master in no time at all!  
For any mu-specific technical questions, check out the [mu wiki](https://github.com/stelligent/mu/wiki).

# The Path to Becoming a mu Master

## AWS CloudFormation (cfn)
Get a basic idea of what [AWS CloudFormation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) does by watching the [3 minute long introductory video](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).  
Go through the official AWS CloudFormation [Getting Started guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.html).

Do you understand:
- [ ] What a cfn template does?
- [ ] How to declare resources and their properties within a cfn template?

Are you able to:
- [ ] Create a cfn stack
- [ ] Monitor a cfn stack's progress by viewing the 'Events'
- [ ] Update a cfn stack
- [ ] Delete a cfn stack

## mu

1. Listen to the [mu podcast](https://stelligent.com/2017/07/20/devops-on-aws-radio-mu-devops-on-aws-tool-episode-10/)

Can you answer these questions from the podcast:
- [ ] What is mu and what problem does it solve? What are its benefits?
- [ ] How does someone use mu (including prereqs)?
- [ ] What types of programming languages and platforms are supported?
- [ ] What types of AWS architectures does mu support (i.e. traditional EC2, ECS, Serverless, etc.)?
- [ ] Which AWS services are provisioned by mu?
- [ ] Does mu support non-AWS implementations?
- [ ] What does mu install on my AWS account?

2. Watch the [mu video example](https://stelligent.com/2017/07/28/screencast-full-stack-devops-on-aws-tool/)

Can you answer these questions from the video:
- [ ] What command line command allows you to view and follow along with the logs of the pipeline?
- [ ] What command allows you to view a list of your mu environments?
- [ ] What are the different stages in Casey's CodePipeline pipeline? (Hint: the first one is 'Source')
- [ ] What are some of the cfn stacks that were created by mu? (Hint: one is 'mu-cluster-dev')
- [ ] What AWS service uses buildspec.yml files?
- [ ] What kind of database did Casey add to the mu.yml template?
- [ ] Casey mentions an AWS service that manages secrets. What is it?
